## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require webklex/laravel-git-hook
```

## Setup

Add the service provider to the providers array in `config/app.php`.

``` php
'providers' => [
    Webklex\GitHook\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider::class,
];
```

## Publishing

You can publish everything at once

``` php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Webklex\GitHook\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

This library is designed to handle the automatic deployment by git hooks 
as simple as possible. There isn't much todo to get started: just add the
Provider and edit the `config/git-hook.php` file to make it fit your needs.


Custom configuration can be made within the `config/git-hook.php` file:

| Parameter          | Default                           | Options                                   | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | :-------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| email_recipients   | `[]`                              | `[['name' => '', 'address' => ''], ...]`  | Get notified by mail. Just add your credentials                                                           |
| email_email_sender | `['address' => '', 'name' => '']` | `['address' => '', 'name' => '']`         | Specify a custom email sender address                                                                     |
| repo_path          | `null`                            | Leave empty to auto detect the vcs root   | Perhaps your repository is somehow specially structured, if that's the case, specify your repository path |
| allowed_sources    | `[]`                              | `['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', ...]`     | If you want to secure the deployment process a bit more, whitelist the remote repository IPs              |
| remote             | `origin`                          |                                           | Your remote branch name                                                                                   |
| git_path           | `/usr/bin/git`                    |                                           | Where is the git binary located                                                                           |
| logfile            | `git-hook`                        |                                           | Name of the logfile. It will be stored under storage/logs                                                 |
| service            | `github`                          | `github`, `gitbucket`, `gitlab`                     | Define your remote git service. This is required to identify the payload                                  |
| url                | `git-hook`                        |                                           | Define the deployment url. Keep in mind, that the given parameter will be added to your app.url           |
| before_pull        | `[]`                              | `['down', ['cmd', ['arg1' => 1]]]`        | If you have any commands that have to be called before a pull event, specify them here                    |
| after_pull         | `[]`                              | `['cmd', ['cmd1', ['arg1' => 1]], 'up']`  | If you have any commands that have to be called after a pull event, specify them here                     |


If you are concerned someone could guess it, use a more cryptic url such as: `JHFUjhd67567JHFGhsd78236784wegfJHFghdgf`


## Potential problems:

Please make sure your `www-data` user can actually perform a git pull on the server without 
having to enter a password:
so you might want to take a look at ssh-keys or something similar
